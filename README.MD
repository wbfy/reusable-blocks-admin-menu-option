# Reusable Blocks Admin Menu Option Plugin For WordPress

## Synopsis

This plugin will add an option to the WordPress admin menu for quick access to the Manage Reusable Blocks page.

## Description

You can access the Manage Reusable Blocks page from within the Gutenberg block editor
by using the option in the Reusable section of the add block dialog. However, especially
when building a new site, I have found this to be quite a lot of clicks just to make a
quick change.

This is a simple plugin that adds an entry into the admin menu for quicker direct
access to the page.


## How To Use

You can find full usage and installation instructions on the plugin homepage:

You can also download a ready compiled installation zip file from here for the
latest stable version.

## Requirements

* WordPress 5.0 and above
    * With the Gutenberg block editor enabled
* PHP 5.6 and above
